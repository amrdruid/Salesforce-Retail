## Walkthrough

- From `dealers_controller.rb` we have two main APIs, `add_point_of_sales_dealers` and `dealers_within_range`

- `add_point_of_sales_dealers` allows adding retails to the database by internal employees

- `dealers_within_range` returns the retails around your current lng and lat in form of JSON

- We have a rake task that does what `add_point_of_sales_dealers` does. We can execute it through `docker-compose exec web bundle exec rake dealers:generate_and_save_to_db`

- We use `Sentry` for tracking errors 

- We use `Figaro` gem to manage secrets
